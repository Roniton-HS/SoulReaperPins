This Addon marks spawn locations of Dark Fissures / Soul Reaper Devices (Mini Dolmen). The later spawn only after completing the prolog quest for it.  
Soul Reaper Devices are needed for 2 achievements in the game.  
All spawn location data comes from the [UESP Map](https://gamemap.uesp.net/eso/?world=tamriel&x=0.500&y=0.500&zoom=2.359).
This means that this addon does not mark EVERY location since not all of them are documented.  
Also keep in mind that spawn rates are kind of low for these events.
